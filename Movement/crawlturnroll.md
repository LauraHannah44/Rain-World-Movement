## Description
It is possible to begin a roll by holding down during the middle of a buffered [[crawlturn]]. It is possible to buffer the crawl-turn by holding backwards within the first 5 frames of beginning the [[crouch]] state.

## Notes

## Performed from
[[crawlturn]], [[crouchtumble]], [[jumptumble]], [[throwtumble]], [[crawlturncanceltumble]]
