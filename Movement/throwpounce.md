# Throw Pounce
![[throwpounce_header.gif]]
## Description
When close to a wall, including during [[wallslide]], throwing a [[heavyitem]] towards the wall and pressing jump triggers a [[wallpounce]] without any initial movement.

## Notes
This only works for items which are thrown forward with force, i.e. rocks, spears, etc.

The slugcat can be sliding down a wall with 0 horizontal speed and still triggering a throwpounce. This is because [[throwboost]] always boosts the slugcat's speed to over 7.5, the threshold for triggering a [[wallpounce]]

If the slugcat is grounded when triggering a throwpounce, the throwpounce becomes a [[throwspring]], which has different properties and is generally higher.
