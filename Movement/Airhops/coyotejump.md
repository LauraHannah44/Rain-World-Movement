# Coyote Jump
![[coyotejump_header.gif]]
## Description
There is a 5-frame window where slugcat is able to jump mid-air after walking off a ledge. This allows for slightly longer running jumps across gaps.

## Notes
It is possible to extend this move to an [[ecoyotejump]] by crouching just before you leave the ledge, then returning to standing state as you jump.

This move works identically when walking off the tip of a horizontal pole.
