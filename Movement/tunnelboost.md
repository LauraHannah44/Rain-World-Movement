# Tunnel-Boost
![[tunnelboost_header.gif]]
## Description
By pressing jump while climbing in a tunnel, slugcat will accelerate foward for a couple of tiles, before slowing and taking some frames to begin crawling again. If slugcat begins the tunnel-boost with its feet against a tile, either after turning a corner, exiting a pipe, or backing up to a wall, the boost will accelerate slugcat far more tiles before slowing.

## Notes
Due to the end-lag, this is not worth it unless you perform the move with slugcats feet against a wall or pipe.

It is also posable to avoid the end-lag at the exit of a tunnel resulting in a [[tunnelexitboost]].
