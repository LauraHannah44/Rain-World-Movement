# Extended Slide
![[eslide_header.gif]]
## Description
There is a window to extend a [[slide]] by throwing a weapon item backwards during frames 10 through 15 of the slide. The extended slide lasts considerably longer, and has a slightly larger window to perform the corresponding [[epounce]] and [[eflip]].

## Notes
Unlike normal slides, extended slides are not stopped by slugcat becoming airborn. This allows for any eslide-exiting move to be performed after dropping down to a lower floor, and for the ending pop-up of the eslide to occur midair.

At the end of a max-length extended slide, slugcat is popped upright out of crouching state. It is possible to use this to perform an [[eairhop]].

As the extended slide starts, slugcat has a very high speed, however after a few frames on the ground the speed becomes the same as a regular slide.

There is a window to [[eipounce]] by pressing jump on the same frame as throw (frame 0), and returning directional input to forwards the frame after. This only works if the extended slide begins on frame 14 or 15 of the slide.

There is a window to [[ehop]] by pressing jump during frames 1 through 26 (after the throw input).

There is a window to [[epounce]] or [[eflip]] by pressing jump during frames 27 through 31 (after the throw input).

There is a window to [[slidethrow]] by throwing an item forwards mid-slide.
