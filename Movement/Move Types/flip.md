# Flip
## Description
A flip is a move which sets slugcat spinning at a constant speed in the air. It continues on a variable arc until contact with the ground.

## Notes
It is not possible to press up or down to set slugcats orientation midair in the flip state. Due to this, slugcat will almost always land into the standing state.

It is always possible to [[fliproll]] out of the flip state.

It is always possible to [[downthrow]] during the flip state.

The direction of spin mid-air is based on the direction slugcat turned towards before performing the flip. This becomes relevant when performing a [[turnstoredflip]], as it is usually possible to have chosen the direction of the turn long before performing the flip.

## Variants
[[turnflip]], [[slideflip]], [[iflip]], [[eflip]], [[turnstoredflip]]
