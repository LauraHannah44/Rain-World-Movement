![[extendedslideinstantjump_header.gif]]
## Description
This move is the version of an [[extendedslidejump]] where jump is performed on the first possible frame.

## Notes
There is a window to [[extendedslideinstanthop]] by inputting down the frame after the jump. This is far less effective on later [[extendedslidejump]] moves, as slugcat tends to flop backwards midair and not get anywhere near as much distance.

## Performed from
[[extendedslide]]

## Allows for


## Chains to
