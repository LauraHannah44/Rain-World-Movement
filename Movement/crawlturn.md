# crawlturn - Crawl-Turn
<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LauraHannah44/Rain-World-Movement/main/Files/crawlturn_header.gif>
## Description
It is possible to crawl-turn from the crouch state by pressing the opposite direction to slugcat's facing. This causes slugcat to flip over to crouch facing the opposite direction.

## Notes
There is a window to [[crawlturncancel]] by pressing up during frames 1-4.

It is not possible to crawl-turn for the first 5 frames after entering the crouch state. Due to this it is possible to buffer a first-frame crawl-turn. This allows a [[crawlturnroll]] if down is pressed as slugcat reaches the middle of the buffered crawl-turn.

Slugcat becomes temporarily airborne during a crawl-turn, which drains any existing jumpstorage.
