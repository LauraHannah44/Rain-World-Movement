# Jump
![[jump_header.gif]]
## Description
By inputting jump while on the ground, slugcat can jump 2 tiles into the air. This allows for scaling 4-tile-high walls using a [[ledgepullup]].

## Notes
Slugcat jumps 1 frame after the input is received, unlike with all other inputs.

It is possible to buffer this move by inputting jump within 5 frames of reaching a canJump state (i.e. feet on the ground in standing state). The jump will occur as soon as this is reached, allowing the player to conserve most horizontal momentum.
