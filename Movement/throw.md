# Throw
## Description
By pressing the throw button, slugcat will throw whatever is in the leftmost hand. This can be done in a variety of moves to achieve a few different outcomes.

## Notes
A thrown [[heavyitem]] will have a slight upward trajectory until about 8 tiles away from slugcat. Due to this, a thrown grenade will explode in 2-high tunnels, killing the player.

A thrown [[lightitem]] can be tossed with a more arching trajectory by holding the up input when throwing it.

## Variants
[[throwboost]], [[throwtumble]], [[slidethrow]], [[downthrow]], [[eslide]], [[crouchthrow]]
