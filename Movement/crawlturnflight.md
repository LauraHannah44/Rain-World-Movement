# crawlturnflight - Crawl-Turn Flight
![[crawlturnflight_header.gif]]
## Description
It is possible to fly upwards from a [[crawlturn]] by repeatedly inputting left and right for 3 frames at a time, after some setup timings. By using slightly different left and right input timings, it is possible to control ascent, descent, and slow left/right travel midair.

## Notes
If slugcat collides against geometry mid crawl-turn flight, the state will usually break and need to be reset with a new crawl-turn on the ground.
