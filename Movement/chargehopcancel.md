# chargehopcancel - Charge-Hop-Cancel
![[chargehopcancel_header.gif]]
## Description
It is possible to gain 6 jump-boost when grounded by inputting down to [[crouch]], and pressing and releasing jump before slugcat fully enters the crouch state.

## Notes
This move exploits the 6 jump-boost slugcat gains at the start of a [[chargehop]], which is given as long as jump is pressed and released, when slugcat is not standing up. Usually the jump-boost would be lost as a jump when fully crouching guarantees slugcat to become airborn.
