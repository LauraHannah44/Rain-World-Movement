# Roll
![[roll_header.gif]]
## Description
It is possible to roll under certain conditions by holding down and left/right. For a variable number of frames (40-60), slugcat will travel along the ground while spinning. From a roll, a jump input will produce a variable-height [[rollpounce]].

## Notes
The number of frames the roll lasts for varies randomly depending on which method was used to begin the roll.

Rolls can ascend 1-tile differences in floor geometry.

There is a window at the very end of the roll in which a jump input produces a [[rollslide]] without needing to re-press down and forward.

## Performed from
[[droproll]], [[crawlturnroll]], [[crouchtumble]], [[jumptumble]], [[pounceroll]], [[fliproll]]

## Allows for
[[rollpickup]], [[fastroll]]
