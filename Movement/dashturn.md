# Dash-Turn
![[dashturn_header.gif]]
## Description
By turning around after [[run|running]] for more than 10 frames in the same direction. slugcat gains a burst of speed. With an early jump input, this move can chain to a [[turnflip]], and with a later input you can perform a [[turnjump]].

## Notes
Due to some startup frames to running, forward must be held for 12 frames from standing still to dash-turn.

It is possible to delay the speed-boost of this move using a [[turnstore]], by standing and running in the turn direction after interrupting the turn once it begins.

It is also possible to perform this move without room for an uninterrupted run-up using [[runstore|runstorage]], by standing and running for any number of frames in the run-direction, then turning.
