# Slide Pole-Momentum Jump
![[slidepmjump_header.gif]]
## Description
It is possible to perform a [[polemomentumjump]] from a [[slide]] by pressing up and jump as slugcat reaches a 2-tall pole or [[downthrow|downthrown]] spear. Slugcat will float above the tip of the pole, allowing for an [[airhop]] with roughly a tile of extra height.

## Notes
It is unclear what causes slugcat's feet to not snap to the pole, as this is a significant problem for a lot of [[slidepmjump]] timings too.
