# Charge-Hop
![[chargehop_header.gif]]
## Description
By holding jump for 20 frames when crouching, slugcat's back arches and horizontal inputs are restricted until the jump button is released. Slugcat will then leap forward with a longer arc than a normal jump, allowing it to cross further gaps.

## Notes
This move does not use a fixed arc, so holding forward from the very start of the hop is important for maximising distance travelled.

Like all [[hop]] moves, it is possible to input up to [[airorientation|orient]] slugcat into the standing state midair. This allows for a [[ledgepullup]] or [[polehop]], helping with certain long jumps.
