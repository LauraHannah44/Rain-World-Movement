# chargehop - Charge-Hop
![[chargehop_header.gif]]
# Description:
By holding jump for 20 frames when [[crouch|crouching]], slugcat's back arches and horizontal inputs are restricted until the jump button is released. Slugcat will then leap forward with a longer arc than a normal jump, allowing it to cross further gaps.

# Notes:
This move does not use a fixed arc, so holding forward from the very start of the hop is important for maximising distance travelled.

# Performed from:
[[crouch]]

# Allows for:
