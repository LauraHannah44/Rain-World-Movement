![[hop_header.gif]]
## Description
When crawling on the ground, it is possible to perform a tile-high hop by pressing jump, which gives slugcat some extra momentum.

## Notes
This move can be very useful for preserving momentum upon landing from [[pounce|pounces]], as the airtime can be used to return slugcat to [[airorient]] into the standing state.

When only slugcats head chunk is on the ground, this move gives almost no height.
