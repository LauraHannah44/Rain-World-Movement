# Jump-Store
![[jumpstore_header.gif]]
## Description
Jump-boost is a value in the game's code which determines height during certain moves, based on how long jump is held as the move begins. For most moves, it is set to a non-zero value as slugcat leaves the ground, and is "cashed in" for upwards velocity for every frame jump is held.

Some moves send slugcat airborn with velocity without setting jump-boost to a value. Thus, it's useful to store jump-boost in order to significantly increase the height of these moves.

It is possible to store jump-boost value, or to jump-store, by performing a move which sets jump-boost without then becoming airborn.
