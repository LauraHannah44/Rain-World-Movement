# ecoyotejump - Extended Coyote Jump
![[ecoyotejump_header.gif]]
# Description:
It is possible to perform this move in place of a [[coyotejump]] by crouching just before you leave a ledge, then returning to standing state as you jump, within 5 frames of leaving the ground.

# Notes:
The timing for entering the crouching state is similar to that of the [[ledgedrop]]. In fact this move might just be a ledge-drop coyote jump.
