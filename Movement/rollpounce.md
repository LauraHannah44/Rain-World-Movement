# rollpounce - Roll-Pounce
<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LauraHannah44/Rain-World-Movement/main/Files/rollpounce_header.gif>

## Description
A variant of a [[pounce]], produced by pressing jump at any point during a [[roll]]. The height of the roll-pounce depends on how many frames slugcat has rolled for before the jump input.

## Notes
This move can be rolled out of only if slugcat falls from high enough. It is possible to reach this height on flat ground by waiting until the last few frames of most rolls.

It is possible to buffer the jump input in order to roll-pounce on the first frame of the roll, giving a very short burst of forward momentum. This lends itself well to a [[crouchhop]] in order to keep some of the momentum.

## Performed from
