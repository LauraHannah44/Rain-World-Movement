# Pole-Bounce
![[polebounce_header.gif]]
## Description
When slugcat is travelling travelling horizontally while upright and midair, it is possible to skip off a horizontal pole with a very precise jump input as slugcats feet drop to the level of the pole.

## Notes
The window to perform this move is fewer frames the faster slugcat is falling, as the move is based on the position of slugcat's bottom chunk relative to the pole.
