# Description:
By holding up while slugcat is [[walk|walking]], and releasing up around the time of a [[jump]], slugcat will rotate backwards midair. By holding foward and down for long enough before hitting the ground, it is possible to [[roll]] from this really fucked up jump.

This move is made significantly easier if the jump lands 1 tile lower than it began.

With an item throw, the window to perform this move gets bigger.
