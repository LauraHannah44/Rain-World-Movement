# Coyote Wall-Jump
![[coyotewalljump_header.gif]]
## Description
If you pull away from a [[wallslide]], there is a 15-frame window where slugcat is able to [[walljump]] mid-air.

## Notes
This move does not give any extra height than a normal [[walljump]], but can be used to duck under obstacles, or just to make the window for repeated [[walljump|walljumps]] less punishing.

There is a version of this move called an [[throwdoublewalljump]] which requires an item throw but allows for leaving the wall by a [[walljump]], thus giving the player significantly more height.
