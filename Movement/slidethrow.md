# Slide-Throw
![[slidethrow_header.gif]]
## Description
It is possible to propell a spear or rock-type item forwards out of the slide state by pressing throw. The item will have a downward trajectory and ricochet once off any surface it contacts.

## Notes
The Monk character cannot perform this move.

Due to the downward trajectory of the item initially, slugcat can slidethrow a spear towards the head of a lizard, which will impale as a [[mouthspear]] as long as the lizard is facing the spear with its mouth open.
