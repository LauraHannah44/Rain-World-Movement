# Description:
If you pull away from a [[wallslide]], there is a 15-frame window where slugcat is able to jump mid-air.

# Notes:
This move does not give any extra height than a normal [[walljump]], but can be used to duck under obstacles.

There is a version of this move called an [[eawallhop]] which requires an item throw but allows for leaving the wall by a walljump, thus giving the player significantly more height.

# Performed from:
