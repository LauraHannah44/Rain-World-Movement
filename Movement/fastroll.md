## Description
This is a version of [[roll]], produced by holding a controller joystick at an angle just below horizontal while rolling. The roll will be considerably faster, and last for a shorter duration.

## Notes
Due to the shortened duration of this move, it is not possible for it to produce a [[rollpounce]] high enough to chain to another roll. 

The roll ends in the standing state.
