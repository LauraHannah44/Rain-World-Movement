# walljump - Wall-Jump
![[walljump_header.gif]]
# Description:
By pressing jump while holding towards a wall during a [[wallslide]], slugcat will jump from the wall with a fixed height.

# Notes:
There is a large window to perform this move, even holding away from the wall slightly early, so lining up directional input changes with jump presses is ideal for maximising the height obtained per jump.

It is possible to gain height by wall-jumping multiple consecutive times up a pair of opposite walls, with at most 4 tiles of air between them.

# Performed from:
