# Tunnel-Slide-Pounce
![[tunnelslidepounce_header.gif]]
## Description
After a [[slidetunnelentry]], under short stretches of horizontal tunnel (<6 tiles), it is possible to gain significant horizontal speed by timing a [[slidepounce]] to occur inside the tunnel, then holding jump as slugcat leaves the other end in order to [[jumpstoredboost]] out of the other end.

## Notes
It is possible to gain 8 [[jumpstore]] with this move, by remaining in the tunnel by releasing jump or inputting backward (or in longer tunnels in general).

When performed downwards with a vertical slide tunnel-entry, it is only possible to store the jump boost, as the move slows slugcat to a halt.

## Performed from
[[slidetunnelentry]]

## Allows for
