# pounce- Pounce
## Description
The pounce state (RocketJump in code) sets slugcat at an angle based on its current velocity. It continues on a variable arc, usually set towards the left or right, until contact with the ground.

## Notes
It is not possible to press up or down to set slugcats orientation midair in the pounce state. Due to this, slugcat will always land into the crouch state.

It is always possible to [[roll]] out of the pounce state, with the exception of the [[rollpounce]].

## Variants
[[rollpounce]], [[slidepounce]], [[ipounce]], [[epounce]], [[eipounce]]
