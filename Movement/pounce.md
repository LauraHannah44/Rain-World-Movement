# pounce- Pounce
## Description
The pounce state (RocketJump in code) sets slugcat at an angle based on its current velocity. It continues on a variable arc, usually set towards the left or right, until contact with the ground.

## Notes
It is not possible to press up or down to set slugcats orientation midair in the pounce state. Due to this, slugcat will always land into the [[crouch]] state.

It is always possible to [[roll]] out of the pounce state, with the exception of the [[rollpounce]].

## Variants
[[rollpounce]], [[slidepounce]], [[ipounce]], [[epounce]], [[eipounce]]
