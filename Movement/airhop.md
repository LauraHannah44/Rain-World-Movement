# Air-Hop
## Description
When slugcat becomes airborn without use of the jump button, there is a 5-frame window after leaving the ground to hop by pressing jump. There is an equivalent window for a [[wallhop]], with 15 frames within which slugcat is still able to [[jump]] after leaving a [[wallslide]].

## Notes
The variables in code which account for this are canJump and canWallJump. They are set to 5 and 15 respectively when in contact with the floor or wall respectively, and decrement by 1 every frame. While they are non-zero, slugcat is able to jump as normal. They are set to 0 upon jumping.

## Variants
[[aerialwallhop]], [[coyotejump]], [[crawlturnjump]], [[extendedslideairhop]], [[extendedaerialwallhop]], [[extendedcoyotejump]], [[flippolemomentumjump]], [[groundedwallhop]], [[jumppolemomentumjump]], [[momentumwallhop]], [[poleboostpolemomentumjump]], [[polecoyotejump]], [[polemomentumjump]], [[slidepolemomentumjump]]
