# flippmjump - Flip Pole-Momentum Jump
![[flippmjump_header.gif]]
## Description
It is possible to perform a [[polemomentumjump]] by grabbing a pole while upside down from a [[flip]], and reaching the tip (usually with a [[poleboost]]) while still upside down. Slugcat will float above the tip of the pole, with its body reorienting back upright, allowing for an [[airhop]] with 1-2 tiles of extra height.

## Notes
Because slugcats feet are above the tip of the pole, left/right do not need to be held to avoid snapping to the tip of the pole.

Slugcats feet are higher up before it lets go of the pole, so this move allows for upwards of 2 tiles of extra jump height for poles which are close enough to a possible flip move.
