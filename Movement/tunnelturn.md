# tunnelturn - Tunnel-Turn
![[tunnelturn_header.gif]]
# Description:
When crawling in tunnels, pressing jump while holding the input direction towards slugcats feet will cause it to shake for a second, before flipping around to face in the other direction. 

# Notes:
If done in the downward direction, slugcat will instead enter [[tunnelfreefall]].

If done towards slugcats head, slugcat will instead perform a [[tunnelboost]].

This is useful as slugcat travels faster when moving forwards through tunnels than backwards.
