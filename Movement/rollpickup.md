# rollpickup - Roll-Pickup
![[rollpickup_header.gif]]
# Description:
It is possible to pick up items from the [[roll]] state by letting go of the down input, quickly pressing grab then re-inputting down.

# Notes:
This only seems to work when slugcat is in certain orientations in the roll, as sometimes letting go of down will instantly put slugcat into the [[stand]] or [[crouch]] state.

From a [[fastroll]], it is always possible to pick up items, as the controller angle isn't simulating the down input which would change the grab input into a drop input.
