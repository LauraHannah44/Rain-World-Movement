# Points Table
Most creatures will award the player points when killed in Hunter Mode. These are the points that will become the 'KillScore' when the player's [final score is calculated](scorecalculation.md). Below are each of the creatures worth in points.

The top left of the hibernation screen will show which creatures have been killed in the completed cycle.

## Notable exceptions
There are some creatures that will not yield any points when killed. This group includes creatures that can be instantly eaten (batflies, jellyfish, infant centipedes and baby noodleflies) and other small creatures in general (spiders, leeches, jellyfish, vulture grubs and grappling worms).

## "Unkillable" creatures
Both the garbage worms and the guardians are creatures that are technically "unkillable". The garbage worms have no health value, while the guardians have an unreasonably high one (10,000,000). Since both of these creatures were not meant to be killed, doing so is only possible in a normal playthrough by using glitches - which yields the player the default score value of 1.
