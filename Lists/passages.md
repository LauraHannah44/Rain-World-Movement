# Passages
Passages are in-game objectives that can be completed during a playthrough of Rain World. Normally, completing a Passage gives a slugcat the ability to travel instantly to any shelter, but in [[huntermode|Hunter Mode]], each Passage works as a score multiplier instead.

There are a total of ten passages that can be obtained.

### Survivor
Rest 5 times at max Karma level. **This Passage must be completed for any other achievement progression to be made.**

### Wanderer
Enter and rest in every region.

### Outlaw
Kill enough creatures that cannot be eaten by Survivor or Monk. Deaths reduce Passage progress and not killing valid creatures during a cycle resets it.

### Chieftain
Reach maximum scavenger reputation. This Passage can be lost if scavenger reputation drops.

### Hunter
Eat only [[foodtypes|meat]] for 6 cycles in a row (12 points at 2 points per cycle). Dying counts as -1. Eating *vegetarian food* resets the Passage progress.

### Friend
Rest with a friendly lizard 3 cycles in a row. Resting without a friendly lizard resets progress.

### Monk
Eat only [[foodtypes|vegetarian food]] for 6 cycles in a row (12 points at 2 points per cycle). Dying counts as -1. Eating *meat* resets the Passage progress.

### Saint
Do not take aggressive action against any creature for 6 cycles in a row (12 points at 2 points per cycle). Any aggressive action resets progress. Throwing rocks or sticks near creatures can count as aggressive action. Dying is -1.

### Scholar
Touch 3 of the colored pearls in the game. 

### Dragon Slayer
Kill one of each of the following lizards: Green, Pink, Blue, White, Black and Yellow.
