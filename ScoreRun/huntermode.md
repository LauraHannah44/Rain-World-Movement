# Hunter Mode
After beating Rain World with either Survivor or Monk, your save file will now have the Hunter character available. While playing as Hunter, besides the [physics changes](hunterphysics), there are two main mechanical differences which will be relevant for this note:

- **Hunter has a 20 cycle limit**. After 20 cycles have passed, death is now permanent and each survived cycle becomes exponentially more difficult to survive.
- Everything you do during the game is being tracked to tally up a **score** at the end of your playthrough. The main way to to raise your score is by killing creatures and getting Passages.

As such, a playthrough of the Hunter Mode is generally referred to as a Score Run. Even though Hunter can be played with the same dynamics as Survivor, these notes will focus on the concept of playing a run while attempting to get the maximum possible score at the end of the run.
