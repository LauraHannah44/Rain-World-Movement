# Hunter Objectives
During a playthrough of [[huntermode|Hunter Mode]], there are three main objectives that can be completed. Each one of them will [[scorecalculation|reward points]] at the end of the run.

## Helped Five Pebbles
- Rank: 40 points
This objective is completed when Hunter is seen by Pebbles, in his room, while holding the Green Neuron. A hibernation is also required to save the progress. Completing the objective is not related to receiving the extra cycles from Five Pebbles.
It is also worth mentioning that swallowing the Neuron immediately after Pebbles returns it to the player can lead to the [[neuronduplication|Neuron duplication glitch]]. It is recommended to wait until Hunter has left their chamber to ingest it.

## Delivered Payload
- Rank: 100 points
This objetive is completed when precisely when the Green Neuron is going towards Looks to the Moon. Basically, this means Hunter is in the same screen as Moon and the neuron is no longer in their hand or stomach, but instead has been floating and went towards the iterator. It is not necessary to watch the entire revival cutscene, but hibernating afterwards to save is required.
Taking the Neuron during this sequence and swallowing it can lead to the [[infintecycleglitch|infinite cycle glitch]].

## Ascended
- Rank: 300 points
This objective is completed when Hunter ascends. This means finishing the game by meeting with the Void Worm in Depths.
