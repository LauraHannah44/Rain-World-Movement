The top left of the hibernation screen will show which creatures have been killed in the completed cycle.

## Notable exceptions
There are some creatures that will not yield any points when killed. This group includes creatures that can be instantly eaten (batflies, jellyfish, infant centipedes and baby noodleflies) and other small creatures in general (spiders, leeches, jellyfish, vulture grubs and grappling worms).
