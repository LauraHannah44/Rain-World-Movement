# General Score Run Reference
This page goes over the basics of a Hunter Score Run. These runs often require a lot of improvising and adaptation, so the information here serves more as a guideline than an actual route. Whenever new tech is discovered, this page will be updated accordingly.

## Main Goals
When doing a playthrough of [[huntermode|Hunter Mode]] while trying to maximize your [[scorecalculation|final score]], here are the main things to keep in mind.
- Kill the most possible creatures - generally by staying around Outskirts, Industrial Complex and Chimney Canopy.
- Go talk to Five Pebbles.
- Get all the Passages.
- Last but not least, Ascend.

One thing that should be noted too is that **everything is easier with a vulture mask**. Getting one can be done as early as the first cycle and becoming consistent in obtaining it is pretty much an essential tool for a score runner.

Finally, [[doublespawn|double spawning]] will be mentioned a few times in this page. Doubling is essential for getting top-scoring runs, but if your goal is to learn and not necessarily break into the top 10, there is no need to double regions. Average scores of up to 20k points can be obtained without a single double-spawned region.

## Cycle 19
Cycle 19 is the first cycle of a Score Run. Even though Hunter will always start in the same place and a player's general goal will always be the same, there are several possible ways to approach it. 

It is also worth noting that dying or quitting in cycle 19 will not count towards the final run statistics. This means that you can restart as many times as you want - and simply pressing "continue" on the death screen has no consequence on your score, since your next attempt will start a fresh run. This also means that cycle 19 is the only moment in a Score Run in which quitting to roll for a better cycle timer is allowed.

### The Neuron, the Pearl and the Spear
Hunter starts the game with the Green Neuron on its hand, a green pearl on its stomach and a spear on its back. The spear is actually just a regular spear, but the title of this section sounded nicer with three words.

The Green Neuron can be used to get points by showing it to Five Pebbles and using it to revive Looks to the Moon, however it's not always worth completing any of these objectives. Having the Green Neuron with you generally means you need to use your stomach slot for it, which could be used to hold a vulture grub. **So, should you keep the Neuron with you or throw it away at the start?** There are two things that should be considered to answer that:
- Since showing it to Pebbles is only worth 40 points, using the grub to kill 40 points worth of vultures in more lucrative, but more difficult for beginner runners.
- Currently, reviving Moon is generally not worth the time and the points, both for beginner and experienced runners. Even though the objective is worth 100 points, completing it often requires spend one or more cycles going through Shoreline - which is a terrible region for scoring and navigating in general. Creatures are scarce and not worth a lot of points, vultures and king vultures have a lot of advantage over a swimming slugcat and the leviathan can easily end a cycle a lot earlier.

The green pearl is mostly used to cross the Farm Arrays toll, located in `LF_E03`, but it can also be used to gain scavenger reputation on Sky Islands.

### The path to Outskirts
The most common - and currently believed to be most optimal - route to take on cycle 19 is going down Farm Arrays towards Outskirts. The value in this route comes from the fact that it's mostly consistent and straightforward while also leaving you the closest you can get to Outskirts, which is one of the better regions for hunting.

The first important part of this path starts on `LF_A04`, where the first vulture grub of the run is available. This grub can be taken to [[vulturehunting|trap vultures]] on `LF_D03` and get an early vulture or king vulture mask and, in case the green neuron isn't taken at the start of the run, can be swallowed for later use.

The second point of interest is the aforementioned Scavenger Toll in `LF_E03`. The easier and more reliable way to cross it is using the green pearl, however killing the toll can also be considered if you're up for some extra points. Notably, the scavenger reputation Hunter loses in the first cycle is capped earlier then it should be, so destroying the toll has no major consequences as long as the Outskirts Toll is [[tollcheese|cheesed]] on the next cycle.

The third important part of the cycle is at `LF_D06`. This is the first reasonable shelter Hunter has access to, `LF_S01`, in case the cycle timer is too short to get to the bottom shelter. Sleeping here is not ideal, since it means you will need to waste some time navigating Farm Arrays on the next cycle. In case this rest is not needed, the room is still relevant due to the pearls that spawn in it. Taking one of the pearls, preferably the white one, is important to cross the toll in Outskirts.

Before finishing cycle 19, there is an optional room that can be visited in case the player has been unable to get a vulture mask so far. `LF_C01` has two vulture grubs that can be used in conjunction with the exploding spears from the scavenger stash just 2 rooms away, at `LF_A17`, to snatch a late-cycle vulture kill. Both getting the mask here or in `LF_D03` can be inconsistent due to roaming scavengers, but the upper room generally implies easier vulture fights.

As previously stated, finishing the cycle on the bottom shelter, `LF_S01`, with a vulture or king vulture mask, is generally the ideal way to start a Score Run.

### The path to Sky Islands
Alternatively, another route that could be taken on cycle 19 is towards Sky Islands - which a lot less traditional but there are high-scoring runs that have used it in the past. The value in this path comes from the fact that it allows you to get closer to both Five Pebbles and the optimal [[vulturecheese|vulture cheese spot]], Chimney Canopy.

The first point of interest is, again, the vulture grub from `LF_A04`. This grub can be used to [[vulturehunting|hunt vultures]] and get a mask in `LF_D03` just like in the path to Outskirts, however simply storing it and climbing up `LF_F02` towards `LF_A07` is also acceptable. The latter generally means spending a cycle in Sky Islands without a vulture mask, which is more likely to be acquired upon entering Chimney Canopy. 

This initial climb towards Sky Islands can have a few adult or overgrown centipedes, so having two spears or a sporepuff is recommended.

Sky Islands starts with four uneventful rooms, so first place you will be hunting here is probably `SI_D06`. The long flat surfaces are very favorable for killing the lizards even without a mask and a lot of creatures from other rooms tend to congregate here. In case the green pearl was kept, it can generally be traded to scavs during around here too.

The next important part of this path is `SI_C02`. Even though this room doesn't have many natural spawns, cyans are constantly going in and out of the pipe that leads to `SI_C07` and can be stabbed with relative ease.

Finally, the Sky Islands cycle 19 can either end on `SI_S04` or `SI_S05`. Both of these shelters can lead to easy starve fixes in case you want to [[doublespawn|double spawn]], but remember that doing so will prevent doubling Chimney Canopy on the following cycle - which is likely more optimal.

### Concerning Scavengers
While playing as Hunter, the slugcat's reputation will start at a lower then default value for all creatures. This means, among other things, that most scavengers will try to kill you on sight. So when meeting a wandering pack or lonely scavenger, there are three viable options:
- Stay away from its range. If the scav is holding a spear upwards as in a throwing motion, it can probably hit you.
- Stab it before it stabs you.
- Drop everything you're holding and hope the scavenger decides to trade instead of killing you. This generally means this scav will no longer try to randomly kill you during this cycle.

However, scavengers from tolls will only attack the player on sight in case their reputation is extremely low. Using tolls, either naturally or [[tollcheese|cheesing]] is generally the best way to raise your reputation and stay safe from wandering scavs.

## Getting Passages
As explained in the [[passages|Passages]] page, each Passage will serve as a score multiplier in the end of the run. These are the general strategies for obtaining each one.

Note that once a Passage is completed, it is impossible to lose Passage progress - except for Cheiftain. Only a completed Passage will count as a multiplier.

### Survivor
Survivor is the first Passage needed to obtain the other ones and consists of just hibernating at maximum karma. There isn't much to say about getting it, except to avoid dying twice in a row. Ideally, a player would complete survivor in the first 6 cycles, but missing it is not run-ending. 

These first cycles are mostly used to [[fixingdoubles|doubling and saving]] the three main regions for hunting - Outskirts, Industrial and Chimney - and maximize the amount of kills without being distracted by doing specific objectives for other Passages.

### Outlaw
Outlaw is a rather simple passage to get in a Score Run, since you will already spend most of your cycle trying to kill creatures and the creatures that count for Outlaw progress can be eaten by Hunter.

An easy way to complete Outlaw in a single cycle is using [[vulturecheese|vulture cheese]]. Otherwise, spending a cycle or two [[lizardhunting|killing lizards]] (which is the default Hunter gameplay) should generally be enough to achieve the Passage.

### Hunter
Completing the Hunter Passage happens naturally during a Hunter run, since the requirement for Passage progress is simply eating meat for five cycles in a row and Hunter can feed mostly on meat only. Remember that neurons do not count as meat, so make sure not to eat one during Hunter cycles (while being full, a neuron can be stored in Slugcat's stomach without breaking Hunter).

The most important detail is to have a clear goal of when to start Passage progress: before or after the Saint/Monk cycles - given that Monk progress will break Hunter, as expected.

### Scholar
Scholar Passage progress happens when Slugcat touches a colored pearl and luckily there are two colored pearls near the top of Five Pebbles, which is always visited in Score Runs.

### Dragon Slayer
### Saint and Monk
### Friend
### Wanderer
### Chieftain
## Visiting Five Pebbles
