# General Score Run Reference
This page goes over the basics of a Hunter Score Run. These runs often require a lot of improvising and adaptation, so the information here serves more as a guideline than an actual route. Whenever new tech is discovered, this page will be updated accordingly.

## Main Goals
When doing a playthrough of [[huntermode|Hunter Mode]] while trying to maximize your [[scorecalculation|final score]], here are the main things to keep in mind.
- Kill the most possible creatures - generally by staying around Outskirts, Industrial Complex and Chimney Canopy.
- Go talk to Five Pebbles.
- Get all the Passages.
- Last but not least, Ascend.

One thing that should be noted too is that **everything is easier with a vulture mask**. Getting one can be done as early as the first cycle and becoming consistent in obtaining it is pretty much an essential tool for a score runner.

## Cycle 19
Cycle 19 is the first cycle of a Score Run. Even though Hunter will always start in the same place and a player's general goal will always be the same, there are several possible ways to approach it. 

It is also worth noting that dying or quitting in cycle 19 will not count towards the final run statistics. This means that you can restart as many times as you want - and simply pressing "continue" on the death screen has no consequence on your score, since your next attempt will start a fresh run. This also means that cycle 19 is the only moment in a Score Run in which quitting to roll for a better cycle timer is allowed.

### The Neuron, the Pearl and the Spear
Hunter starts the game with the Green Neuron on its hand, a green pearl on its stomach and a spear on its back. The spear is actually just a regular spear, but the title of this section sounded nicer with three words.

The Green Neuron can be used to get points by showing it to Five Pebbles and using it to revive Looks to the Moon, however it's not always worth completing any of these objectives. Having the Green Neuron with you generally means you need to use your stomach slot for it, which could be used to hold a vulture grub. **So, should you keep the Neuron with you or throw it away at the start?** There are two things that should be considered to answer that:
- Since showing it to Pebbles is only worth 40 points, using the grub to kill 40 points worth of vultures in more lucrative, but more difficult for beginner runners.
- Currently, reviving Moon is generally not worth the time and the points, both for beginner and experienced runners. Even though the objective is worth 100 points, completing it often requires spend one or more cycles going through Shoreline - which is a terrible region for scoring and navigating in general. Creatures are scarce and not worth a lot of points, vultures and king vultures have a lot of advantage over a swimming slugcat and the leviathan can easily end a cycle a lot earlier.

The green pearl is mostly used to cross the Farm Arrays toll, located in `LF_E03`, but it can also be used to gain scavenger reputation on Sky Islands.

### The path to Outskirts
The most common - and currently believed to be most optimal - route to take on cycle 19 is going down Farm Arrays towards Outskirts. The value in this route comes from the fact that it's mostly consistent and straightforward while also leaving you the closest you can get to Outskirts, which is one of the better regions for hunting.

The first important part of this path starts on `LF_A04`, where the first vulture grub of the run is available. This grub can be taken to [[vulturehunting|trap vultures]] on `LF_D03` and get an early vulture or king vulture mask and, in case the green neuron isn't taken at the start of the run, can be swallowed for later use.

The second point of interest is the aforementioned Scavenger Toll in `LF_E03`. The easier and more reliable way to cross it is using the green pearl, however killing the toll can also be considered if you're up for some extra points. Notably, the scavenger reputation Hunter loses in the first cycle is capped earlier then it should be, so destroying the toll has no major consequences as long as the Outskirts Toll is [[tollcheese|cheesed]] on the next cycle.

The third important part of the cycle is at `LF_D06`. This is the first reasonable shelter Hunter has access to, `LF_S01`, in case the cycle timer is too short to get to the bottom shelter. Sleeping here is not ideal, since it means you will need to waste some time navigating Farm Arrays on the next cycle. In case this rest is not needed, the room is still relevant due to the pearls that spawn in it. Taking one of the pearls, preferably the white one, is important to cross the toll in Outskirts.

Before finishing cycle 19, there is an optional room that can be visited in case the player has been unable to get a vulture mask so far. `LF_C01` has two vulture grubs that can be used in conjunction with the exploding spears from the scavenger stash just 2 rooms away, at `LF_A17`, to snatch a late-cycle vulture kill. Both getting the mask here or in `LF_D03` can be inconsistent due to roaming scavengers, but the upper room generally implies easier vulture fights.

As previously stated, finishing the cycle on the bottom shelter, `LF_S01`, with a vulture or king vulture mask, is generally the ideal way to start a Score Run.

### The path to Sky Islands
Alternatively, another route that could be taken on cycle 19 is towards Sky Islands - which a lot less traditional but there are high-scoring runs that have used it in the past. The value in this path comes from the fact that it allows you to get closer to both Five Pebbles and the optimal [[vulturecheese|vulture cheese spot]], Chimney Canopy.
