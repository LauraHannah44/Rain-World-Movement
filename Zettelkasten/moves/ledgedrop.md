# ledgedrop - Ledge-Drop

# Description:
It is possible to increase fall speed off a ledge by holding down as slugcat reaches the edge. With good timing, this can allow for a [[roll]] from a 1-tile drop. It is possible to extend the drop-fast-fall window by stalling for a couple of frames with a backward input.
