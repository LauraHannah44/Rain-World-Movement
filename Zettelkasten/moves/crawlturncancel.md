# crawlturncancel - Crawl-Turn-Cancel

# Description:
There is a window to begin a crawl-turn-cancel by pressing up during frames 1-4 of a [[crawlturn]]. Slugcat pops into the air and ends up in the standing state. Slugcat reaches significantly higher above the ground if the cancel is on frame 1 or 4 of the crawl-turn.

# Notes:
Performed on frames 1 or 4, this move allows slugcat to reach a tile off the ground within a few frames without any jump input. Due to this, a variant of an [[airhop]] can be performed called a [[crawlturnjump]].

If this move is performed on a ledge such that the crawl-turn flops over the edge, and up and the crawl-turn direction is held, slugcat will accelerate down exponentially until reaching a floor.

For the frame-1 cancel, if down, jump and the direction slugcat is turning away from are pressed around 4 frames after the quick crawl turn cancel begins, slugcat will shoot up 6-7 tiles into the air due to an animation glitch. This move is called a [[quickcrawlturnjump]].
