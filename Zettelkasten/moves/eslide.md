# eslide - Extended Slide

# Description:
There is a window to extend a [[slide]] by throwing a weapon item backwards during frames 10 through 15. The extended slide lasts considerably longer, and has a slightly larger window to perform the corresponding [[epounce]] and [[eflip]].

# Notes:
At the end of an extended slide, slugcat is popped upright out of crouching state. It is possible to use this to perform an [[airhop]].
As the extended slide starts, slugcat has a very high speed, however after a few frames on the ground the speed becomes the same as a regular slide.

There is a window to [[eipounce]] by pressing jump on the same frame as throw (frame 0), and returning directional input to forwards the frame after.
There is a window to [[ehop]] by pressing jump during frames 1 through 26 (after the throw input). The first frame of these is named an [[eihop]] as it carries significantly more speed, and has a variant called an [[eichop]], achieved by inputting down on frame 2, after jump on frame 1.
There is a window to [[epounce]] or [[eflip]] by pressing jump during frames 27 through 31 (after the throw input).
There is a window to [[slidethrow]] by throwing an item forwards mid-slide.
