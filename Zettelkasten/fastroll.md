# Description:
This is a variant of [[roll]], produced by holding a controller joystick at an angle just below horizontal while rolling. The roll will be considerably faster, and last for a shorter distance.

# Notes:
Due to the shortened duration of this move, it is not possible for it to produce a [[rollpounce]] high enough to chain to another roll.

# Performed from:
[[roll]]

# Allows for:
[[rollpickup]]

# Chains to:
[[rollpounce]]
