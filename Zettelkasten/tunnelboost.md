# tunnelboost - Tunnel-Boost
![[tunnelboost_header.gif]]
# Description:
By pressing jump while climbing in a tunnel, slugcat will accelerate foward for a couple of tiles, before slowing and taking some frames to begin crawling again. If slugcat begins the tunnel-boost with its feet against a tile, either after turning a corner or backing up to a wall or den, the boost will accelerate slugcat far more tiles before slowing.

# Notes:
Due to the endlag, this is not worth it unless you perform the move with slugcats feet against an edge.
