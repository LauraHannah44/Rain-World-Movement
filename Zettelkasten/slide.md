# slide - Slide

# Description:
It is possible to slide while [[walking|walking]] by pressing down then jump at roughly the same time. The move can last for roughly 17 frames by holding forward throughout and has several windows throughout its duration to chain to other moves.

# Notes:
The move can be started the frame walking begins, effectively sliding from standing.

Slides are not stopped by ledges, slugcat will stay against the floor for the duration.

There is a window to [[ipounce]] or [[iflip]] by pressing jump on frame 2.

There is a window to [[slidepounce]] or [[slideflip]] by pressing jump during frames 14 through 16.

There is a window to extend the slide into an [[eslide]] by throwing a weapon item backwards during frames 10 through 15.

There is a window to [[slidethrow]] by throwing an item forwards mid-slide.

It is possible to perform a [[slideparkour]] by pressing jump as the slide comes into contact with a wall.

After the first 2-3 frames of the slide, slugcat will be temporarily airborne, such that any [[jumpstore|jumpstorage]] will be lost if the jump key is released or the move will fail due to burning the jump storage if the key is held.

If a slide crosses over a vertical tunnel entrance, it is possible to convert momentum downwards into the tunnel by tapping down. With correct timing, a jump upon entering the tunnel will give slugcat either 6.5 or 8 [[jumpstore|jumpstorage]].

Similarly if the slide enters a ground level horizontal tunnel entrance, a well-timed jump will give slugcat 8 [[jumpstore|jumpstorage]].
