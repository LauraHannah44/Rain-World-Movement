# Description:
It is possible to propell an item forwards out of the slide state by pressing throw. The item will have a downward trajectory and ricochet once off any surface it contacts.

# Notes:
The Monk character cannot perform this move.
Due to the downward trajectory of the item initially, slugcat can slidethrow a spear towards the head of a lizard, which will impale as a [[mouthspear]] as long as the lizard is facing the spear with its mouth open.
