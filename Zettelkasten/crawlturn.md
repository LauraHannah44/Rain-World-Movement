# crawlturn - Crawl-Turn
![[crawlturn_header.gif]]
# Description:
It is possible to crawl-turn from the [[crouch]] state by pressing the opposite direction to slugcat's facing. This causes slugcat to flip over to crouch facing the opposite direction.

# Notes:
There is a window to [[crawlturncancel]] by pressing up during frames 1-4.
It is not possible to crawl-turn for the first 5 frames after entering the crouch state. Due to this it is possible to buffer a first-frame crawl-turn. This allows a [[crawlturnroll]] if down is pressed as slugcat reaches the middle of the buffered crawl-turn.

Slugcat becomes temporarily airborne during a crawl-turn, which drains any existing jumpstorage.
