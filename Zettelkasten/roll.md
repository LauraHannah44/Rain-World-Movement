# Description:
It is possible to roll under certain conditions by holding down and forward. For a variable number of frames (40-60), slugcat will travel along the ground while spinning. From a roll, a jump input will produce a variable-height [[rollpounce]].

# Notes:
The number of frames the roll lasts for depends on which method was used to begin the roll.

Rolls can ascend 1-tile differences in floor geometry.
