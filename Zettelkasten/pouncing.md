# pouncing - Pouncing

# Description:
The pounce state (RocketJump in code) sets slugcat at an angle based on its current velocity. It continues on a variable arc, usually set towards the left or right, until contact with the ground.

# Notes:
It is not possible to press up or down to set slugcats orientation midair in the pounce state. Due to this, slugcat will always land into the crouching state.

# Variants:
[[rollpounce]], [[slidepounce]], [[ipounce]], [[epounce]], [[eipounce]]
