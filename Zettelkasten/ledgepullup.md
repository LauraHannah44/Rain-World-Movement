# ledgepullup - Ledge Pull-Up
![[ledgepullup_header.gif]]
# Description:
By holding towards a ledge as slugcat is up against it, it is possible for slugcat to pull up over it. If slugcat is lower on the wall, a jump input may be required, but the pull-up will act the same.

# Notes:
There is a window to perform a [[crawlturncancel]] (specifically a with a simulated first frame up input), by holding away from the ledge during the pullup.

Ledge pull-ups allow slugcat to ascend walls 2 tiles higher than it would otherwise be able to, i.e. a regular jump is 2 tiles high, so slugcat can climb 4 tile walls using only a jump and ledge pull-up.
