![[ledgepullup_header.gif]]
# Description:
By holding towards a ledge as slugcat is up against it, it is possible for slugcat to pull up over it. If slugcat is lower on the wall, a jump input may be required, but the pull-up will act the same.

# Notes:
There is a window to perform a [[crawlturncancel]] (specifically with a simulated first frame up input), by holding away from the ledge during the pullup.
