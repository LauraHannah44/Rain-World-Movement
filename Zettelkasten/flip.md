# flip - Flip
# Description:
The flip state (Flip in code) sets slugcat spinning in the air. It continues on a variable arc, usually set towards the left or right, until contact with the ground.

# Notes:
It is not possible to press up or down to set slugcats orientation midair in the flip state. Due to this, slugcat will almost always land into the [[stand]] state.

It is always possible to [[fliproll]] out of the flip state.

It is always possible to [[downthrow]] during the flip state.

# Variants:
[[turnflip]], [[slideflip]], [[iflip]], [[eflip]]
