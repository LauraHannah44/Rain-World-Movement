# ipounce - Instant Slide-Pounce
![[ipounce_header.gif]]
# Description:
This [[pounce]] variant is produced by pressing jump on frame 2 of a [[slide]]. It has a higher arc than a regular slide pounce as the slide does not have time to deccelerate slugcat horizontally beforehand.

# Notes:
Due to the slide not fully starting, jumpstorage does not interfere with this move and so can be executed to increase the distance by holding jump for some frames as the move begins.

# Performed from:
[[slide]]

# Allows for:


# Chains to:
[[crouch]], [[pounceroll]]
