# quickcrawlturncancel - Quick Crawl-Turn-Cancel

# Description:
There is a window to begin a quick crawl-turn-cancel by pressing up on frame 1 of a [[crawlturn]]. Slugcat pops higher into the air and quickly accelerates back down to the floor much faster than usual, ending in the standing state.

# Notes:
If this move is performed on a ledge such that the crawl-turn flops over the edge, and up and the crawl-turn direction is held, slugcat will accelerate down exponentially until reaching a floor.
If down, the direction slugcat is turning away from and jump are pressed around 4 frames after the quick crawl turn cancel begins, slugcat will shoot up 6-7 tiles into the air due to an animation glitch. This move is called a [[quickcrawlturnjump]].
