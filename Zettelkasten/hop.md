# hop- Hop
# Description:
Outside certain slide windows and tunnels/poles, jump inputs usually allow for slugcat to propel itself around 2 tiles off the ground.

# Notes:
It is possible to press up or down to set slugcats orientation midair in the hop state. Due to this, slugcat can either land into the [[stand]] or [[crouch]] state based on player choice.

# Variants:
[[jump]], [[ehop]], [[eichop]], [[turnhop]], [[airhop]], [[wallhop]]
