# ipounce - Instant Slide-Pounce

# Description:
This [[pounce]] variant is produced by pressing jump on frame 2 of a [[slide]]. It has a higher arc than a regular [[slidepounce]] as the slide does not have time to deccelerate slugcat horizontally beforehand.

# Notes:
Due to the slide not fully starting, [[jumpstore]] does not interfere with this move and so can be executed to increase the distance by holding jump for some frames as the move begins.

# Performed from:
[[slide]]

# Allows for:


# Chains to:
[[crouch]], [[roll]]
