![[rollpounce_header.gif]]
# Description:
A variant of a [[pounce]], produced by pressing jump at any point during a [[roll]]. The height of the roll-pounce depends on how many frames slugcat has rolled for before the jump input.

# Notes:
This move can be rolled out of only if slugcat falls from high enough. It is possible to reach this height on flat ground by waiting until the last few frames of most rolls.

# Performed from:
[[roll]], [[fastroll]]

# Allows for:
