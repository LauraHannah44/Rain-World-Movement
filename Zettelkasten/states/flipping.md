# Description:
The flip state (Flip in code) sets slugcat spinning in the air. It continues on a variable arc, usually set towards the left or right, until contact with the ground.

# Notes:
It is not possible to press up or down to set slugcats orientation midair in the flip state. Due to this, slugcats state upon landing is determined by its orientation upon hitting the ground.
