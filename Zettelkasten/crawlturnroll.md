# Description:
It is possible to begin a roll by holding down during the middle of a buffered [[crawlturn]]. It is possible to buffer the crawl-turn by holding backwards within the first 5 frames of beginning the [[crouch]] state.

# Notes:
It is reasonable to enter the crouch state either by performing a first crawl-turn (in order to buffer a second one back), or by pressing down from the [[stand]] state.
