# polemomentumjump - Pole-Momentum Jump
![[polemomentumjump_header.gif]]
# Description:
By holding to the side as slugcats feet approach the top tile of a pole, it is possible to leave the tip of the pole with a 5-frame window to jump. If this is performed with enough vertical momentum, it is possible to jump more than 1 tile higher than slugcat would from the tip of the pole.
