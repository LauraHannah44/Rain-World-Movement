# Passage Storage
Passage Storage is the concept of mantaining Passage progress from cycles that weren't saved by the game. This involves abusing the properties of the **starve mechanic** and it's mainly used during score runs.

## Step-by-Step Tutorial
Passage Storage involves actions taken during two consecutive cycles. The first one will be called "cycle A" and the second one will be called "cycle B". In the [[saintmonk|Saint/Monk Passage guide for Hunter]], these are called "cycle N" and "cycle N-1", since Hunter cycles count down.

1. During **cycle A**, the player will need to survive while completing [[passages|one or more Passage requirements]], but starve at the end of the cycle. During the hibernation screen, Passage progress will be shown.

2. During **cycle B**, the player will need to interrupt the cycle before it finishes. This can be done by either dying or meeting an Echo. This will result in the game returning to the beginning of cycle A, but with the Passage progress obtained in the previous cycle A saved.

## Important Details
- The **only** data saved from cycle A is Passage progress and Karma raise from Pebbles. This means things such as kills will count for Dragon Slayer and Outlaw progress, but will not be counted for the final Hunter "statistics" screen.
- Nothing done in cycle B is saved, except the Echo interaction if an Echo is met. This means the player can safely do things that would reset or lower passage progress in made cycle A. This also means kill will not count for the final Hunter "statistics" screen.
- As stated in [[scorerunrules|the Score Running rules]], only Passage progress in Saint, Monk, Wanderer or Friend is allowed in runs by using Passage Storage.
