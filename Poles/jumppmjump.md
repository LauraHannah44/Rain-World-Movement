# Jump Pole-Momentum Jump
![[jumppmjump_header.gif]]
## Description
It is possible to perform a [[polemomentumjump]] by [[jump|jumping]] as slugcat reaches a 2-tall pole or [[downthrow|downthrown]] spear, then holding up a couple of frames later. Slugcat will float above the tip of the pole, allowing for an [[airhop]] with roughly a tile of extra height.

## Notes
It is unclear what causes slugcat's feet to not snap to the pole, as this is a significant problem for a lot of [[slidepmjump]] timings too.
